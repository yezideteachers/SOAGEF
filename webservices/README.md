# SOA1 WEB services examples

This directory contains the implementation of two basic systems, one using JAX-RS to define a REST-based service and the second one using JAX-WS to define a SOAP-based service.

To avoir redundancy, please refer to the root README for global information about this repository, or to the different child READMEs for specific information related to SOAP or REST.
